## Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook project tackles the challenge of classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. This dataset is a staple in the machine learning community for benchmarking image recognition and computer vision algorithms.

## Contents of the Notebook

- **Description**: Introduces the CIFAR-10 dataset and its characteristics.
- **Libraries**: Showcases the necessary libraries required to run the notebook.
- **Data**: Details the steps to load, preprocess, and explore the dataset.
- **Data Augmentation**: Discusses methods to augment the dataset to improve model robustness.
- **Modeling and Training**: Constructs and trains the model for image classification.
- **Testing**: Explains the procedures for evaluating the model and analyzing the outcomes.
- **Predictions**: Demonstrates how the model makes predictions on new data.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
3. Execute the notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance.
